          I'm certain that I'm not the smartest person around, and I don't have
          a perfect memory or a fancy degree. However, I'm confident that I can
          be the most productive and dedicated person at my work and in learning
          new things. I understand that achieving greatness in any field is
          challenging and that it's not attainable by working just 40 hours a
          week. That's why, over the past six months, I've been pushing myself.
          Through small, consistent steps, the practice of atomic habits, and by
          following the example of the right role models, I've managed to
          increase my commitment to{" "}
          <span className="focus">80 hours per week</span>, and I'm not
          finished.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, if I compete with a regular developer who has better knowledge, I
          will <span className="focus">catch up with them in a 1-2 months</span>{" "}
          and start to making a gap. I realize that many people are concerned
          about work-life balance, and some believe I may be on the wrong path.
          But I gained 17 kg in the gym, reached an almost fluent level in both{" "}
          <span className="focus">Polish and English in only 5 months</span>,
          and learned a lot about programming, so{" "}
          <span className="focus">
            I'm positive that I'm on the right track ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
          </span>
        </p>
      </div>
