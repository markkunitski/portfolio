        <h5 className="mb-2">What sparked my interest in web development?</h5>
        <p>
          I was trying myself as a professional cybersport player, it was my
          passion for 3 years, but things didn't work out. However, the idea of
          becoming great at something is still with me. I want to create great
          things that people will love, and earning their respect is the most
          satisfying thing for me. I ventured into IT because my best friend has
          been working in IT for over 10 years, and I believe the best way to
          learn new things is to have a good teacher. I started with Python and
          then transitioned to HTML/CSS/JS. Additionally, during my teenage
          years, I freelanced as a web designer, so it combines my passion and
          skills. My experience as a UI/UX designer from 2018 to 2020, where I
          worked with tools like Photoshop and Figma, helped me gain valuable
          insights into user-centered design and user interface enhancement.

      <div className="elem mb-10 observe">
        <h5 className="mb-2">A particular project that stands out</h5>
        <p>
          The most remarkable project I've worked on is NODAUNT. It was the most
          challenging and significant project. The idea behind it was to create
          a website for finding restaurants and tours in a city based on user
          preferences and location. The main concept was to alleviate the agony
          of choice for users by providing them with ready-made orders and
          tours. People would no longer need assistance to enjoy traveling to
          new places. I employed the best technologies I know, such as NEXT.js,
          Tailwind CSS, React, and Leaflet for maps. Given my skills and
          knowledge in web design, I was responsible for everything the user
          sees, including the logic and design.

          What keeps me motivated during long working hours?
        </h5>
        <p>
          If you want to become great, you need to increase your chances of
          success. Working at least twice as hard as others enhances those
          chances. People like Elon Musk and David Goggins inspire me. I
          understand that it might seem overwhelming to many, as they worry
          about the work-life balance. I appreciate that, but I aspire for more
          and continually strive for it. Burnout is a concern, and many have
          expressed doubts about my ability to sustain this level of dedication,
          but their skepticism only fuels my drive. I feel better than ever,
          especially when I overcome challenges and become smarter, more
          resilient, and a better developer and person.

          Learning to code and becoming proficient in web development
        </h5>
        <p>
          I began my coding journey with the guidance of a friend who served as
          my mentor. Starting from scratch, as I had no prior experience, and I
          struggled with programming in Pascal during my school years. I began
          with HTML/CSS and gradually introduced JavaScript. I later
          incorporated frameworks for both design and logic. Fortunately, with
          the introduction of ChatGPT, my progress accelerated significantly.
          Beyond the fundamentals, I wanted to understand the core of computer
          science, so I delved into algorithms and data structures. I completed
          the popular Berkeley course, CS61A, which was a big hit for me. I also
          started working with the book "A Programmer's Perspective, 3rd
          Edition." My knowledge base expanded exponentially, and I gained a
          comprehensive understanding of how software works.

          Mentors, role models, and influential resources
        </h5>
        <p>
          My friend, who helped me learn to code, has been a valuable mentor and
          role model. His unwavering support and guidance have been instrumental
          in my web development journey. I draw inspiration from individuals
          like Elon Musk and David Goggins, who have achieved remarkable feats
          through hard work and dedication. While I acknowledge that working 80+
          hours a week might seem excessive to many, and they worry about
          work-life balance, my desire for more and my pursuit of excellence
          keep me motivated. Burnout is a concern, but the doubt expressed by
          acquaintances only fuels my determination to prove them wrong. I've
          never felt better, and the most rewarding feeling is the sense of
          overcoming challenges and becoming a smarter, more resilient, and
          better individual and developer.

          Keeping up with the evolving field of web development
        </h5>

          Staying updated with industry trends is crucial. I achieve this by
          reading blogs and articles, attending conferences, and following
          fellow developers on social media. Active participation in online
          developer communities and knowledge-sharing platforms is essential.
          Continuous learning is my mantra to thrive as a developer because the
          web development field is in a constant state of evolution, and I aim
          to be at the forefront of these changes.

          In the future, I aspire to take on more challenging and complex

          set. My growth as a frontend developer will be fueled by reading
          books, articles, attending conferences, and working on personal
          projects. Feedback from fellow developers and mentors will also be
          invaluable on my journey to become the best in the programming field.
          I'm committed to working 80+ hours a week to achieve my goals and
