        <h5 className="mb-2">What sparked my interest in web development?</h5>
        <p>
          My journey into web development ignited with a burning passion. It all
          began during my time as a professional esports player, where the quest
          for greatness became a part of me. Even though my esports journey took
          an unexpected turn, the desire to excel and create something
          extraordinary still drives me.

        <h5 className="mb-2">Whats the most inspiring project i worked on?</h5>
        <p>
          The most challenging and rewarding project in my journey has to be
          NODAUNT. It was a big deal with an even bigger vision: a platform for
          discovering restaurants and city tours that tailored recommendations
          based on preferences and location. The main goal was to take the
          burden of choice off users by offering ready-made orders and tours.
          Thanks to my web design skills, I took charge of everything, from
          logic to design.

        <h5 className="mb-2">What keeps me motivated to work over 80 hours a week?</h5>
        <p>
          I don't mind putting in over 80 hours a week because I believe it's
          the path to greatness. Inspirations like Elon Musk and David Goggins,
          who've achieved amazing things, keep me going. While I get that this
          level of commitment isn't for everyone, I thrive on pushing my limits.
          Friends worried about burnout only fuel my determination.

        <h5 className="mb-2">How did i become proficient in web development?</h5>
        <p>
          My journey into coding has been nothing short of fascinating. My best
          friend was my mentor, guiding me from HTML and CSS basics to complex
          design and logic frameworks. The introduction of chatgpt turbocharged
          my progress. Beyond the basics, I embarked on a deep dive into
          computer science, exploring algorithms, data structures, and more,
          expanding my knowledge exponentially.

        <h5 className="mb-2">My mentors and key resources in my Journey?</h5>
        <p>
          Role models like Elon Musk and David Goggins have a big impact on my
          aspirations. In the world of programming, ULBI TV on YouTube has been
          my go-to teacher for frontend and backend development. But the real
          magic lies in how simple 0s and 1s transform into advanced
          technologies. I aspire to be one of those innovators driving
          cutting-edge tech.

        <h5 className="mb-2">How do i stay updated in web development? </h5>
        <p>
          Staying updated in the ever-evolving web development world is crucial,
          and the internet has fantastic resources. Algorithms tailored for
          information retrieval ensure I get the knowledge I need, sometimes
          before I even know I need it. YouTube, in particular, has been a
          treasure trove of knowledge. Plus, with chatgpt, I can tackle problems
          with info at my fingertips.

        <p>
          In the future, I aim to be among the best in the programming world. My
          journey as a frontend developer is just the beginning of my quest to
          create software that changes the game. To achieve this, I'm seeking
          guidance from mentors who can accelerate my progress, letting me push
          my limits like never before. My commitment to over 80 hours a week is
          all about my unquenchable thirst for growth and improvement.
